# Local Workspace

R&D sandbox. Local AI agents connect to data sources, explore workflows, and codify them as skills that get promoted to the shared gateway.

Context and sessions live at the workspace level:
```
local-workspace/

└── sessions/                        ← per-session notes (YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-slug.md)
```

## MCP Configuration

`.mcp.json` is personal per-operator config and is **gitignored**. Copy `.mcp.json.example`
to `.mcp.json` to get started, then add your integrations.

`.mcp.json` has two kinds of entries — both present at the same time:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-gateway": {
      "url": "https://your-gateway.example.com/sse"
    },
    "stripe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@stripe/mcp", "--tools=all"],
      "env": { "STRIPE_API_KEY": "${STRIPE_API_KEY}" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Gateway entry** — always present. All promoted tools live here.
**Local MCP entries** — added per integration during R&D. Remove once the integration is fully promoted and centralized on the gateway.

**Credentials**: always use `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in the `env` block — never paste a
key value directly. Some MCP setup guides (Perplexity, Linear, etc.) show inline keys;
do not follow that pattern. Real values go in `.env`.

**User-scope MCP servers**: if you've already installed a server via `claude mcp add
--scope user` or the Claude desktop app, you don't need a project-scope entry. The
agent will still track it in `context/mcp-registry.md` so admins know what the gateway needs.

**Restart required**: After editing `.mcp.json`, quit and reopen Claude Code. On first
launch with a new project-scoped server, Claude Code shows a **trust prompt** — you
must approve it or the server silently won't load. If a server is missing after restart:
```bash
claude mcp reset-project-choices   # re-triggers the trust prompt on next launch
```
Note: `claude mcp list` only shows user-scope servers — project-scope servers from
`.mcp.json` won't appear there even when working correctly.

**Tracking**: `context/mcp-registry.md` is the committed record of all MCP tools in
active use — regardless of scope. Admins use this to provision the gateway.

## Available Skills

Invoke with `/skill-name` or let the agent trigger them automatically.

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/workspace-onboarding` | First time in this workspace, or to update your operator profile |
| `/process-capture` | Multi-step workflow to automate across multiple systems |
| `/integration-onboarding` | Connecting a single new data source (MCP or raw API) |
| `/skill-creator` | Building, improving, or testing a single skill |

---

## Available Agents

Use `@agent-name` to invoke directly, or delegate naturally in conversation.

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `@qa-pre-check` | Before pushing a skill — catches CI failures early |
| `@field-enricher` | After capturing a sample API response — writes business definitions |
| `@session-scribe` | At session start or to log a discovery mid-session |
