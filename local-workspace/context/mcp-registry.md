# MCP Registry

Source of truth for every MCP server operators are actively using across the workspace — regardless of whether it is installed at user scope (`~/.claude/settings.json`) or project scope (`.mcp.json`).

Admins read this file to know what the remote gateway needs to support and which env vars to provision on the gateway server.

## How to Update

When onboarding a new integration (Path A — MCP Server), add an entry below.
Run `@integration-onboarding` — it will fill this in automatically.

Fields:
- **scope**: `user` (installed via `claude mcp add --scope user`) or `project` (in `.mcp.json`)
- **install**: the command an operator would run to add it at project scope
- **env**: env var names required — no values, names only
- **skills**: skill directories that depend on this server
